  <h2>Hi! I'm Dawood (pronounced "Da-woodh"), a front end developer with a year of experience in integrating front end parts at Sumtotal Systems india Pvt Ltd.</h2>
  <p>My journey as a Front end Developer started right after i completed my graduation and joined into training as a developer. I was very passionate about building designs right from childhood. </p>
  <p>It was not really web development, but yeah i loved sketching various cartoons, monuments, automobiles., etc from the age of 11. I was very passionate about building designs for bikes and cars but couldnt really move out of India to learn the same.</p>
  <p>When i joined my training after my graduation, i worked hard on it and the design part(front end part) really interested me and this is when i decided that i should become a Front-End Developer and build appealing and beautiful yet simple designs</p>
    <p>Iâ€™m currently undergoing a full fledged self/online training on Front end development to be on path with the current industry standards</p>
